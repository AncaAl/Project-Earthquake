# Project-Earthquake
                  
### Type of analysis:
Data Analytics Project (Reporting, visualization and prediction)

### Overview:
The goal of this project is to extract and analyse earthquake data from the dataset, create an interactive dashboard, and make predictions about tsunamis. 

### Steps:

- **Data Extraction and Cleaning**: Extract earthquake data from a reliable dataset, clean and preprocess the data for analysis.
- **Data Analysis**: Perform detailed analysis to uncover trends, patterns, and insights related to earthquake occurrences.
- **Visualization**: Create an interactive dashboard to visualize earthquake data and analysis results, making it accessible and understandable to a broad audience.
- **Prediction**: Develop models to predict tsunamis.


### Dataset:

Source of DataSet: National Centers for Environmental Information
                   
https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/hazel/view/hazards/earthquake/event-data?maxYear=2024&minYear=1900 

The dataset used for this project contains comprehensive information about past earthquakes and tsunamis, including:

  - *Date and time of occurrence*
  - *Location (latitude and longitude)*
  - *Magnitude*
  - *Depth*
  - *Tsunami indicators*
  - *Other relevant features*
